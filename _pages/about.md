<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am currently pursuing my Ph.D. at the [Urban Mobility Institute (UMI)](https://umi.tongji.edu.cn/), Tongji University, Shanghai, China. I am a member of the [CTIT](https://ctit.tongji.edu.cn/) research group, completing my dissertation on **"Investigating Influencing Factors and Developing Incentive Strategies for the Integrated Usage of Electric Bike-sharing Services and Metro Systems"** under the guidance of Professor Xinghua Li. Prior to this, I received my bachelor's degree from Southwest Jiaotong University in 2020.


I am currently a visiting PhD student at Ghent University.
