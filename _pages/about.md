<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am currently a Ph.D. candidate at the Urban Mobility Institute, Tongji University, Shanghai, China. I received my bachelor's degree from Southwest Jiaotong University in 2020.

My research interests include travel behavior analysis and modeling, the relationship between travel and land use, shared micromobility, and transport equity.
